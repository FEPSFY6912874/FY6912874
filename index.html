    Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
    intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
    learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
    candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
    to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
    Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
    sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
    2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
    presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
    labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
    subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
    learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
    reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
    classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (200
