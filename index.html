        This study intends to determine whether the Halo device created from F1 racing is an ergonomic champion or complicated device - alongside helmet impact, 
        driver reaction and visibility. The Halo has been created by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as a device that safety regulatory change 
        in 2018 after years of fatal/life threatening crashes and extensive crash testing in the real world. The strut is manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy 
        with a strength of stabilized load of 125kN in tensile strength and extended tensile strength of stabilized load and integrity of the research found from similarly
        tested devices on the current market. Thus, this study will assess criteria from an engineering design perspective looking into real world crash testing and 
        important ergonomic considerations to determine the safest functioning advantages and greatest disadvantages of the Halo device. Ultimately this will be corroborated 
        by incident studies such as the Charles Leclerc incident of 2020, the Zhou Guanyu incident of 2022 and even the Romain Grosjean incident of 2020 not to mention minor 
        incidents in 2022 that cause negative aerodynamic assessments and slight benefit to visibility but no decrease in driver response for or against the Halo. 
        Ultimately, Halo is a device worth continuing to use on standard production of F1 cars. It's a complex device but it preserves human life at the best possible level.

  <p class="ex1">
    <pre id="Introduction_Count">
        There is a moment in the cockpit when travelling at speeds over 200 mph, (miles per hour) where the barrier between survival 
        and tragedy is reduced to a millisecond. The halo is a t-shaped multi-joint titanium round beam which is located above the driver's 
        head which has been engineered to protect against the flying debris, collisions with drivers and stationary objects 
        (<a href="#lin2020">Lin and Papadopoulos, 2020</a>).While the Halo is recognised for its essential safety features there are major concerns
        to the ergonomic and visual limitations for the drivers. Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) made the halo device mandatory 
        in all formula one cars in 2018 (<a href = "#FIA2017">FIA , 2017</a>) after several fatal crashes and incidences including the deaths Henry Surtees (2009), 
        Jules Bianchi (2014) and Justin Wilson (2015) and the severe injury to Felipe Massa (2009).  The halo represents modern safety in motorsport. 
        However, it has caused great controversy within the racing community regarding the effects on the car's aerodynamics, driver visibility, 
        and the new challenges the drivers must overcome. The most of concern is neck muscle strain and visual strain (<a href = "#RSM18">Rosalie and Malone, 2018</a>). 
        This research project will focus on whether the safety benefits outweigh the functional limitations.

  <h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
    <pre id="Analysis_Count">
      DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF THE HALO
        The halo was developed by the FIA as a safety measure to protect the drivers from head injuries against collisions with other drivers, 
        with the barriers, tyre impacts and flying debris. The Halo consists of a T-shape multi-jointed beam capable of withstanding forces up to 125kN. 
        This is equivalent to the weight of a double decker bus (<a href = "#Cheru2024">Cherukara and Yeddu, 2024 </a>). 
        
        The Halo is made up from five key components; these include the central pillar, the two rear pillars and the two quarter circle rings (<a href = "#R2022"> Raikar, 2022</a>).
        The Main loop is a c shaped tube that is connected to the central pillar and the rear brackets secure the central pillar to the chassis (<a href = "#R2022"> Raikar, 2022</a>). 
        The Central Pylon which is the front part of the Halo. The V-Transition is the area where the hoop connects to the central pillar to secure the halo (<a href = "#R2022"> Raikar, 2022</a>).

        The halo was attached to the car in three places, this forming part of the primary crash structure which is designed to deflect large objects away from the
        cockpit (<a href "#SSS18">Shendge, Shinde and Patel, 2021</a>). However, integrating the Halo device into the existing car designs there were critical challenges. One challenge was
        due to the aerodynamics being compromised, as airflow was disturbed. Airflow disruption was around the air intake and the rear wing being compromised, the rear 
        wing can reduce the downforce and reduces the engines efficiency and effectiveness (<a href ="Anima"> Anima 2019</a>, <a href ="#lin2020" >Lin and Papadopoulos, 2020</a>).


      
      IMPACT PROTECTION AND SAFTEY REAL SITUATIONS -Inchident
        The Halo’s Protective ability has been demonstrated repeatedly in real-world Formula one since its introduction in 2018. During the Belgian Grand Prix 2018, 
        Charles Leclerc’s Sauber was struck by Fernando Alonso’s airborne McLaren which hit the halo instead of Charles’s head. This was confirmed by the impact dents
        on the halo showing that this device saved Charles’s life (Baldwin , 2018).
        
        Another example of when the Halo saved a driver’s life from a fatal accident occurred to Zhou Guanyu’s crash at Silverstone in 2022. He was involved tear collision
        at the first corner and his car rolled over and was stuck between the tyre barrier and the catch fence (Cherukara and Yeddu,2024). During this accident, the car slid
        on the halo and Zhou was trapped for several minutes. After being rescued and cleared by medical staff, Zhou himself remarked that the halo had “saved” 
        his life (Baldwin, 2022). In Zhou’s Silverstone accident the roll-hoops collapsed on impact which meant only the halo separated his helmet from striking the 
        ground (Kempema, 2024, Baldwin 2022).
        
        Romain Grosjean’s accident in the Bahrain 2020 Grand Prix was another example on how the Halo prevented a fatal incident. The car collided at a speed of
        “140 miles per hour ” (Cherukara and Yeddu,2024) with a stationary barrier that split the car open as it passed through it and mainly due to the halo device that the driver
        survived (Cherukara and Yeddu,2024).When the car hit the Armco barrier the car immediately erupted into flames and there isn’t a question that this accident would have been
        fatal if not for the Halo and immediate medical response (Kempema , 2024).


      MATERIALS BREAKDOWN 

        The halo is manufactured from Ti-6A1-4V (grade 5) titanium alloy (Cherukara , Yeddu 2024 )  which was chosen for is strength and stiffness and resistance
        to impact or corrosion. The titanium can withstand a static load of 125kN(Cherukara , Yeddu 2024).  Finite-element studies show that under impact, 
        Ti-6Al-4V deforms elastically and plastically to dissipate energy while preventing fracture or intrusion into the cockpit (Raikar, 2022).

      VISIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION
        Visibility through the halo device has been a crucial concern since it has been implicated in formula one particularly about the obstruction by the central
        front pillar (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022). A conducted study (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022) with Digital human modelling (DHM) to quantify the visual obstruction 
        by different variations of the halo using driver manikins and a virtual cockpit simulation showed that in figure 1 (Srinivasan , Demirel 2022 figure 5 page 4 )
        showed that the central pillar only created a narrow obstruction directly in front of the driver which confirmed that most of the forward field of view remained 
        unaffected. 
        
        Figure 1 – View of the driver's vision form the front (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022).
        
        It further stated that “the blockage occurs only in a small central region of the driver’s forward view, while lateral visibility remains clear” (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022). 
        Although the study did not measure the on-track lap effects it was concluded that the interference that the halo produced was limited and quantifiable
        and while it slightly reduces visibility the ergonomically affect on the driver's awareness is minimal compared to it proven safety benefits. 
        Supporting this, Demirel, Jennings and Srinivasan (2022) expanded the analysis through early design simulation methods, confirming that perceived obstruction remains
        small enough not to impair task performance or situational awareness during high-speed driving simulations.
 

    CONCLUSION 
        The introduction of the Halo device in formula one represents the most significant advancement in motorsport safety. While it has received criticism for 
        potential aerodynamics and visual disadvantages, the real-world events clearly support the ability for its life saving capabilities. Incidents involving 
        Charles Leclerc, Zhou Guanyu, and Romain Grosjean have shown that the Halo has been instrumental in preventing fatal injuries and has fundamentally changed
        driver safety standards.From an engineering perspective, the use of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) provides the necessary strength, rigidity, and resilience to
        withstand extreme impact forces without compromising the structural integrityof the cockpit. Although minor challenges persist, such as slight visibility 
        obstruction and aerodynamic disruption, these are minimal when compared to the protection it offers. Ultimately, the Halo exemplifies how engineering innovation
        and safety design can coexist in high-performance environments.
