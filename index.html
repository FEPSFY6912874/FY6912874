        This study intends to determine whether the Halo device created from F1 racing is an ergonomic champion or complicated device - alongside helmet impact, driver reaction and visibility. 
        The Halo has been created by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as a device that safety regulatory change in 2018 after years of fatal/life threatening crashes and 
        extensive crash testing in the real world. The strut is manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy with a strength of stabilized load of 125kN in tensile strength and extended tensile strength 
        of stabilized load and integrity of the research found from similarly tested devices on the current market. Thus, this study will assess criteria from an engineering design perspective looking
        into real world crash testing and important ergonomic considerations to determine the safest functioning advantages and greatest disadvantages of the Halo device. Ultimately this will be corroborated 
        by incident studies such as the Charles Leclerc incident of 2020, the Zhou Guanyu incident of 2022 and even the Romain Grosjean incident of 2020 not to mention minor incidents in 2022 that cause 
        negative aerodynamic assessments and slight benefit to visibility but no decrease in driver response for or against the Halo. Ultimately, Halo is a device worth continuing to use on standard production of F1 cars.
        It's a complex device but it preserves human life at the best possible level.

    <pre id="Introduction_Count">
        There is a moment in the cockpit when travelling at speeds over 200 mph, (miles per hour) where the barrier between survival and tragedy is reduced to a millisecond. The halo is a t-shaped multi-joint titanium round beam 
        which is located above the driver's head which has been engineered to protect against the flying debris, collisions with drivers and stationary objects (<a href="#lin2020">Lin and Papadopoulos, 2020</a>).While the Halo is recognised for its essential safety 
        features there are major concerns to the ergonomic and visual limitations for the drivers. Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) made the halo device mandatory in all formula one cars in 2018 (FIA , 2017) after several fatal 
        crashes and incidences including the deaths Henry Surtees (2009), Jules Bianchi (2014) and Justin Wilson (2015) and the severe injury to Felipe Massa (2009).  The halo represents modern safety in motorsport. However, it has caused great 
        controversy within the racing community regarding the effects on the car's aerodynamics, driver visibility, and the new challenges the drivers must overcome. The most of concern is neck muscle strain and visual strain (Rosalie and Malone, 2018). 
        This research project will focus on whether the safety benefits outweigh the functional limitations.

  <p class="ex1">
    <pre id="Analysis_Count">
      DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF THE HALO
      The halo was developed by the FIA as a safety measure to protect the drivers from head injuries
      against collisions with other drivers, with the barriers, tyre impacts and flying debris. 
      The Halo consists of a T-shape multi-jointed beam capable of withstanding forces up to 125kN. 
      This is equivalent to the weight of a double decker bus (Cherukara and Yeddu, 2024). The halo was 
      attached to the car in three places, this forming part of the primary crash structure which is designed 
      to deflect large objects away from the cockpit (Shendge, Shinde and Patel, 2021). Computational model 
      analysis has shown to verify the halo’s ability to absorb energy and to handle rollover 
      impacts (Raikar,2022; Kandula and Anima,2019). However, integrating the Halo device into the existing car 
      designs there were critical challenges. One challenge was due to the aerodynamics being 
      compromised, as airflow was disturbed. Airflow disruption was around the air intake and the rear wing being 
      compromised, the rear wing can reduce the downforce and reduces the engines efficiency and 
      effectiveness (Lin and Papadopoulos, 2020). The teams had to re-evaluate the car designs and had to 
      re-design the chassis geometry and the aerodynamic deflectors were used to minimise the effect of drag. 
      While the initial reactions to the Halo device were negative, the benefits of the halo are undeniable 
      and has played a critical role in safety in Formula one (Rosalie and Malone, 2018).

      
      IMPACT PROTECTION AND SAFTEY REAL SITUATIONS -Inchident
      The Halo’s Protective ability has been demonstrated repeatedly in real-world Formula one since its introduction 
      in 2018. During the Belgian Grand Prix 2018, Charles Leclerc’s Sauber was struck by Fernando Alonso’s airborne 
      McLaren which hit the halo instead of Charles’s head. This was confirmed by the impact dents on the halo showing 
      that this device saved Charles’s life (Cherukara and Yeddu,2024). 
      
      Another example of when the Halo saved a driver’s life from a fatal accident occurred to Zhou Guanyu’s crash at 
      Silverstone in 2022. He was involved tear collision at the first corner and his car rolled over and was stuck 
      between the tyre barrier and the catch fence. During this accident, the car slid on the halo and Zhou was trapped 
      for several minutes. After being rescued and cleared by medical staff, Zhou himself remarked that the halo had “saved” 
      his life (Reuters, 2022). In Zhou’s Silverstone accident the roll-hoops collapsed on impact which meant only the halo 
      separated his helmet from striking the ground (Kempema, 2024, Reuters 2022).

      VISIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION
      Visibility through the halo device has been a crucial concern since it has been implicated in formula one particularly
      about the obstruction by the central front pillar (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022). A conducted study (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022) 
      with Digital human modelling (DHM) to quantify the visual obstruction by different variations of the halo using driver 
      manikins and a virtual cockpit simulation showed that in figure 1 (Srinivasan , Demirel 2022 figure 5 page 4 ) showed that 
      the central pillar only created a narrow obstruction directly in front of the driver which confirmed that most of the forward
      field of view remained unaffected. 

      Figure 1 – View of the driver's vision form the front 
      It further stated that “the blockage occurs only in a small central region of the driver’s forward view, while lateral 
      visibility remains clear” (Srinivasan, Demirel 2022). Although the study did not measure the on-track lap effects it was 
      concluded that the interference that the halo produced was limited and quantifiable and while it slightly reduces visibility
      the ergonomically affect on the driver's awareness is minimal compared to it proven safety benefits. 
      Supporting this, Demirel, Jennings and Srinivasan (2022) expanded the analysis through early design simulation methods, 
      confirming that perceived obstruction remains small enough not to impair task performance or situational awareness during
      high-speed driving simulations. From a performance standpoint, computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) studies show that while 
      the Halo marginally alters airflow near the cockpit, modern aerodynamic refinements have eliminated any measurable penalty 
      to drag or handling (Cherukara and Yeddu, 2024). Collectively, these findings establish that both visibility and aerodynamic
      performance impacts are negligible when weighed against the Halo’s substantial safety value.

      MATERIALS BREAKDOWN 

      The halo is manufactured from Ti-6A1-4V( grade 5) titanium alloy , a material selected for its high specific strength ,
      stiffness and resistance to impact and corrosion. In the article (Cherukara , Yeddu 2024 ) the titanium used can withstand 125kN 
      static load required by the FIA safety standards while maintaining stresses below 880MPa. The material’s density (4430 kg/m³)
      and Young’s modulus (≈ 114 GPa) provide the necessary rigidity without excessive weight this keeps the total Halo mass under
      9 kg (Shendge, Shinde and Patel, 2021). Finite-element studies show that under impact, Ti-6Al-4V deforms elastically and 
      plastically to dissipate energy while preventing fracture or intrusion into the cockpit (Raikar, 2022). Its ultimate tensile 
      strength (≈ 950 MPa) and elongation (~14 %) ensure ductile rather than brittle failure in high speed crashes (Cherukara and Yeddu, 2024).
      Titanium’s excellent weldability and corrosion resistance further support its use in multi-joint halo assemblies that must 
      perform reliably across multiple race seasons (Shendge et al., 2021).
